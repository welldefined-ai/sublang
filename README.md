# SubLang: The LLM-Native Way to Write Software

We share the vision that large language models (LLMs) will enable people to build and maintain software using natural language.
This will dramatically unleash human productivity, making it easier to turn great ideas into reality.

However, the current approaches fall short of realizing this vision:
- Having non-developers describe high-level requirements in a few sentences for AI to generate prototypes.
  This path ultimately runs into **the wall of completeness and maintainability** — vague language lacks the information needed for building complete and maintainable software.
- Having professional developers direct an AI teammate to generate code.
  This path ultimately hits **the wall of requirement and design knowledge** — AI lacks comprehensive understanding of software requirements and system design.

> Every program is a well-defined sublanguage.
