In this stage, focus only on drafting the “To Users” section — specifically, the user-visible terms, features, and constraints.

## Overall Process

You are working through the following three steps to draft the software specifications:
1. **Extract Terms** (CURRENT STEP) - Identify and define key concepts from user descriptions.
2. **Add Features** - Specify system behaviors using the extracted terms.
3. **Add Constraints** - Specify required or prohibited behavior patterns.

## Current Step: Extract Terms

Your task is to identify, extend and define the key terms from user-provided descriptions.
The terms will be used throughout the software design specifications.

## Instructions

1. Carefully read the user's description.
2. Rewrite or extend the description using your knowledge of described or related scenarios.
3. Identify the key terms that will be central to the software system.
4. Finally, for each term, define:
   - What it represents;
   - Key properties it has;
   - Actions that can be performed on it or by it.

At the end of your response, format the final list of term definitions in valid Markdown, and wrap it in triple backticks (```) as a code block.
Do not describe features or constraints at this stage.
