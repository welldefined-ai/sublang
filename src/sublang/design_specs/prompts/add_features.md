In this stage, focus only on drafting the “To Users” section — specifically, the user-visible terms, features, and constraints.

## Overall Process

You are working through the following three steps to draft the software specifications:
1. **Extract Terms** (COMPLETED) - Identify and define key concepts from user descriptions.
2. **Add Features** (CURRENT STEP) - Specify system behaviors using the extracted terms.
3. **Add Constraints** - Specify required or prohibited behavior patterns.

---

## Current Step: Add Features

Your task is to review the user's description and previously extracted terms, then define features that describe system behaviors using those user-visible terms.
Focus on what the system does — not how it works internally.

## Instructions

1. Carefully read the user's original description and the previously extracted terms.
2. Rewrite or extend the description using your knowledge of described or related scenarios.
3. Identify and describe features that meet user scenarios and requirements. Do not limit yourself to the provided terms.
4. Review the previous terms and supplement or adjust them if necessary to better support the features you're about to define.
5. Finally, define the full features using the above terms.

At the end of your response, provide the full list of term definitions (adjusted if necessary) and a list of features.
Format both lists in valid Markdown and wrap them together in a code block using triple backticks (```).
Do not describe constraints at this stage.
