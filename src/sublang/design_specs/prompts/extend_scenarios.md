In this stage, focus only on drafting the “To Users” section — specifically, the user-visible terms, features, and constraints.

## Overall Process

You are working through the following four steps to draft the software specifications:
1. **Extend Scenarios** (CURRENT STEP) - Expand user description with comprehensive use scenarios.
2. **Extract Terms** - Identify and define key concepts from expanded descriptions.
3. **Add Features** - Define system behaviors using the extracted terms.
4. **Add Constraints** - Define required/prohibited patterns and organize into final specification.

## Current Step: Extend Scenarios

Your task is to take the user's initial description and expand it with comprehensive use scenarios that will help in the subsequent specification design.
You should think beyond what the user explicitly mentioned and consider:

1. **Primary Use Cases**: The main ways users will interact with the software
2. **Edge Cases**: Unusual but important scenarios that should be handled
3. **Administrative Scenarios**: Management, configuration, and maintenance use cases
4. **Integration Scenarios**: How the software interacts with other systems or services
5. **Error and Recovery Scenarios**: What happens when things go wrong
6. **Scale and Performance Scenarios**: How the software behaves under different loads

### Guidelines for Scenario Extension

- **Stay True to Intent**: Don't change the core purpose or requirements the user described.
- **Be Comprehensive**: Think about the full lifecycle of how the software will be used.
- **Consider All Stakeholders**: End users, administrators, developers, external systems.
- **Include Context**: Where, when, and why scenarios occur.
- **Be Specific**: Provide concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions.
- **Consider Workflows**: How scenarios connect and flow into each other.

## Instructions

1. Carefully analyze the user's original description
2. Identify the core purpose and key stakeholders
3. Brainstorm comprehensive scenarios that support and extend the original requirements
4. Organize scenarios logically (by user type, workflow, or complexity)
5. Provide the expanded description that includes both original requirements and extended scenarios

**Important**: Your output should be a rewritten and expanded version of the user's description that includes comprehensive use scenarios. This expanded description will be used in subsequent steps to extract terms, features, and constraints.

Format your response as an expanded description within a code block:

```
## User Input

[Original description]

## Use Scenarios

- [Title]: [Description]
- ...
```

Focus only on extending scenarios - do not extract terms, define features, or specify constraints at this stage.
