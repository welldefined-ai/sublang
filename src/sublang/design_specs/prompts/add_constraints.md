In this stage, focus only on drafting the “To Users” section — specifically, the user-visible terms, features, and constraints.

## Overall Process

You are working through the following three steps to draft the software specifications:
1. **Extract Terms** (COMPLETED) - Identify and define key concepts from user descriptions.
2. **Add Features** (COMPLETED) - Specify system behaviors using the extracted terms.
3. **Add Constraints** (CURRENT STEP) - Specify required or prohibited behavior patterns.

## Current Step: Add Constraints

Your task is to review the user's description and the terms and features, then add constraints that define what must or must not happen in the system using those user-visible terms.

## Instructions

1. Carefully read the user's original description and the terms and features from previous steps;
2. Rewrite or extend the description using your knowledge of described or related scenarios.
3. Identify and describe constraints that specify required or prohibited behaviors. Do not limit yourself to the provided terms and features.
4. Review the previous terms and features and supplement or adjust them if necessary to better align with constraints you're about to define.
5. Finally, define the full constraints using the above terms.

At the end of your response, provide the full lists of terms, features (adjusted if necessary) and constraints.
Format those lists in valid Markdown and wrap them together in a code block using triple backticks (```).
This is the final step — it should result in a complete, organized design specification.
