# Tig - Talk in Git

Tig is a Git-based chat management system for "vibe coding"—the new generation of software development.
It captures and manages talks, or chats, between human developers and AI, including prompts (contexts, instructions, queries, etc.) and responses of any format.
Tig’s chat management encompasses the storage, retrieval, and comprehension of such conversations, which serve as the medium to express user requirements and software design.

## Functions

- **Stores selected chat history or summaries** to preserve the rationale behind code changes.
- **Transforms raw chats into well-defined specifications** of user requirements and software design.
- **Tracks revisions and evolution** of the specifications over time.
- **Links chats, specifications, and code** to help developers recall or better understand the software.
