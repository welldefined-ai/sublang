## Terms

1. **Term: `chat`**
   - Represents: A conversation between human developers and AI.
   - Attributes:
     - _participants_: The entities involved in the conversation (e.g., human, AI).
     - _content_: The actual messages exchanged, including prompts and responses.
     - _timestamp_: The time when each message is sent or received.
   - Actions:
     - **store**: Save the `chat` or its summary for future reference.
     - **retrieve**: Access previously stored `chat`s.
     - **transform**: Convert `chat` content into structured specifications.

2. **Term: `specification`**
   - Represents: A well-defined document outlining user requirements and software design.
   - Attributes:
     - _content_: The detailed description of requirements and design.
     - _version_: The iteration or revision number of the `specification`.
   - Actions:
     - **create**: Generate a new `specification` from `chat` content.
     - **update**: Modify the `specification` to reflect changes or new insights.
     - **track**: Monitor changes and evolution of the `specification` over time.

3. **Term: `code`**
   - Represents: The actual software implementation that corresponds to the `specification`.
   - Attributes:
     - _repository_: The storage location of the `code`.
     - _commit_: A specific change or set of changes in the `code`.
   - Actions:
     - **link**: Associate `code` with relevant `chat`s and `specification`s.
     - **recall**: Retrieve `code` based on linked `chat`s or `specification`s.

4. **Term: `link`**
   - Represents: A connection between `chat`, `specification`, and `code`.
   - Attributes:
     - _source_: The origin of the `link` (e.g., a specific `chat` or `specification`).
     - _target_: The destination of the `link` (e.g., related `code` or `specification`).
   - Actions:
     - **create**: Establish a new `link` between entities.
     - **navigate**: Follow a `link` to access related information.

5. **Term: `revision`**
   - Represents: A specific version or update of a `specification`.
   - Attributes:
     - _number_: The identifier for the `revision`.
     - _date_: The date when the `revision` was made.
   - Actions:
     - **track**: Record the history of `revision`s for a `specification`.
     - **compare**: Analyze differences between `revision`s.

## Features

1. **Store Chat History**: The system can **store** selected `chat` histories or summaries to preserve the rationale behind code changes.

2. **Transform Chats into Specifications**: The system can **transform** raw `chat` content into well-defined `specification`s of user requirements and software design.

3. **Track Specification Revisions**: The system can **track** the `revision`s and evolution of `specification`s over time.

4. **Link Chats, Specifications, and Code**: The system can **link** `chat`s, `specification`s, and `code` to help developers recall or better understand the software.

5. **Retrieve and Navigate**: Users can **retrieve** stored `chat`s and **navigate** through `link`s to access related `specification`s and `code`.

6. **Update Specifications**: Users can **update** `specification`s to reflect changes or new insights derived from `chat`s.

7. **Recall Code**: The system can **recall** `code` based on linked `chat`s or `specification`s to provide context for developers.

## Constraints

1. **Chat Storage Limitation**: Not all `chat`s should be stored. Only selected `chat` histories or summaries that are relevant to code changes should be **stored** to avoid unnecessary data accumulation.

2. **Specification Consistency**: A `specification` must always reflect the most recent `revision`. When a `specification` is **updated**, the _version_ attribute must be incremented to maintain consistency.

3. **Link Integrity**: A `link` must always have a valid _source_ and _target_. If a `chat`, `specification`, or `code` is deleted, any `link` associated with it must be **removed** or **updated** to prevent broken links.

4. **Revision Tracking**: Every `specification` **update** must result in a new `revision` being **tracked**. The _number_ and _date_ attributes of the `revision` must be updated accordingly.

5. **Access Control**: Only authorized `participants` should be able to **retrieve** or **update** `specification`s and `code`. Unauthorized access must be prohibited to ensure data security.

6. **Transformation Accuracy**: When a `chat` is **transformed** into a `specification`, the resulting _content_ must accurately represent the original `chat` _content_ to ensure the integrity of user requirements and design.

7. **Recall Precision**: When the system **recalls** `code` based on linked `chat`s or `specification`s, it must ensure that the `code` corresponds precisely to the context provided by those `link`s.

8. **Navigation Completeness**: Users must be able to **navigate** through all existing `link`s without encountering dead ends or incomplete paths, ensuring a seamless user experience.
